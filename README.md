# ProScrypt Koans

## Introduction

What's a koan? Here's one definition that seems legit:

> A paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment

I'm no Zen Buddhist monk and hope you'll never abandon reason but have always had trouble learning from lectures and big, fat, door-stopper textbooks. The times I've grown quickest are after jumping in. You may not know what the German word for toilet is but if you're visiting Munich during Oktoberfest, you'll figure it out soon.

I have two goals for you in writing these koans. The first is for you to learn a bit about developing and the second is for you to find out if you like it. If you like developing, it won't matter how slow you learn, or how much better or smarter other people are or how much you suck and soon you'll start to forget that you suck and you'll keep at it, and you'll develop, and you'll realize that's what developing is about: Developing things. Building things. Like a carpenter who cares about matching the grain on the wood trim of a door, even if his general contractor or his client doesn't, you'll be able to point to your work at the end of the day and say, "I made that."

Maybe you have different goals for yourself. Maybe you're a project manager who wants to understand when the neckbeards she works with are shining her on. Maybe you're a farmer, looking for something to pass the time in winter, or an enlisted Marine standing watch, or a sailor on a nuclear submarine, or a bartender with too much college debt, or one of those emo kids in high school who hates football and fantasizes about cheerleaders and wears axe body spray and vapes in the bathroom between classes. A Dad with three kids by two different baby Mommas, who doesn't want them to grow up on food stamps. Maybe you're homeless. I know a guy who was homeless before become an amazing programmer. Maybe you're one of those beauty-queen trophy-wives who has always been quiet, and perfect, and nobody ever thought you were smart, but yesterday some fat ugly slut threw shade on your Jimmy Choo's, and now you're going to show her what is the what. Your motivation doesn't matter to me because it doesn't matter to your code. Your code doesn't have thoughts or feelings. It either a) works or b) doesn't. We don't care how old you are, where you live, what car you drive, what your SAT score was, or if you're good at math or science. You won't need a credit card for these koans, and you won't need to be smart. Let me say that again:

You won't need to be smart.

What you do need are a few hour long blocks of uninterrupted time to get started, a good attitude, some unhealthy curiosity, some obsessiveness, some stubbornness, a little bit of anger, the abilities to focus and to pay attention to detail when you need to get things done, and the humility to ask people for help when you're stuck. Because this tutorial and these koans are hard. Computers and software and other developers will make you feel stupid. They make me feel stupid every day. I wish I knew how to help you find out if you like developing without making you feel stupid. I don't. But I do know that if you finish these koans, nobody will be happier for you than me.

Not even your Mom.

### koans

I'm going to give you a problem, or a koan, to solve, or reflect on, or whatever. You're going to figure out how to solve the koan, and once you've solved it, you're going to move to the next koan, and then solve that koan, and then move to the next koan, and solve it, until you're done or have decided this tutorial is not for you. I'm not going to teach you anything, you're going to teach yourself.

### Your first koan

The site you're reading these koans on is all about managing different versions, or branches, of a code base -- or any group of files -- known as a repository. These koans are organized into different chapters, corresponding to different versions of the code in our repo. Click around to get a feel for the site. When you've figured out how to change the "branch" of this repo to "chapter-1," please do so.
