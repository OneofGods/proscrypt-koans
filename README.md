# ProScrypt Koans

## Introduction

### What is this?

This is a tutorial, the author of which has always been better at teaching than doing. It's intended for people entirely new to developing, but the author's vanity requires him to suggest it may also demonstrate curated development workflows which even salty coding veterans may find useful.

### Who is this for?

Maybe you're a project manager who wants to understand when the neckbeards she works with are shining her on. A Marine standing watch at an embassy or a sailor on a nuclear submarine. A bartender with too much college debt. One of those emo kids who hates football and wears axe body spray and vapes and fantasizes about cheerleaders. A beauty-queen trophy-wife who has always been quiet and perfect and who nobody thought was smart, but yesterday some fat ugly track-suited jerk threw shade on her Masters degree in Art History, and now she's going to show him what is the mothafucking what. Your motivation doesn't matter to me because it doesn't matter to your code. Your code either a) works or b) doesn't. It doesn't care how old you are, where you live, what car you drive, or what your SAT score was. You won't need a credit card for these koans, and you won't need to be smart. Let me say that again:

You won't need to be smart.

### What are its goals?

The author has two goals. The first is for you to learn a bit about developing. The second is for you to find out if you like developing. If you like developing it won't matter how much you suck at it. Like a carpenter who gets splinters and blisters at first, soon you'll start to forget that you suck, you'll keep at it, and you'll realize that's what developing is about: Developing things and sucking at it and blisters. And then sucking less, and building callouses. And then being able to point to something cool you built, in the same way a carpenter might point to a piece of wood trim, the grains of which she matched perfectly.

### What do you need?

What you need to get started are a computer running Windows, OSX, or Ubuntu, an Internet connection, a few hour-long blocks of uninterrupted time, a good attitude, some unhealthy curiosity, some obsessiveness, some stubbornness, some anger, the abilities to focus and pay attention to detail, and the humility to ask the salts for help when you're stuck. Because this tutorial and these koans are hard; computers and software and other developers make me feel stupid every day. I wish I knew how to help you find out if you like developing without making you feel stupid. I don't. But if you finish these koans, nobody will be happier for you than me.

Not even your Mom.

### koans

What's a koan? Here's one definition that seems legit:

> A paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment

I'm no Zen Buddhist monk and hope you'll never abandon reason. But I have always had trouble learning from lectures and big, fat, door-stopper textbooks. The times I've learned quickest are after jumping in. You may not know what the German word for toilet is, but if you're visiting Munich during Oktoberfest, you'll figure it out. So I'm going to give you a koan to reflect on, or solve, or whatever you want to call what you do after reading it. You're going to figure out how to solve the koan, and once you've solved it, you're going to move to the next koan, and the next, and the next, until you're done with the koans or have decided they are not for you. I'm not going to teach you anything, you're going to teach yourself.

### Your first koan

The site you're reading these koans on is an amazing one now owned by Microsoft that's all about managing different versions, or branches, of a code base, or just any group of files known in this tutorial as a repository. These koans are organized into different chapters, corresponding to different versions of the code in our repo. Click around to get a feel for the site. When you've figured out how to change the "branch" of this repo to "chapter-1," please go ahead and do so.
