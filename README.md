# ProScrypt Koans

## Introduction

### What is this?

This is a tutorial of sorts, the author of which has always been better at teaching and helping than at doing. This tutorial is intended for people entirely new to developing, but the author's vanity requires him to suggest it may also demonstrate curated development workflows which even salty veterans with much coding experience may stand back trembling in awe of. The author has two goals for you in the first group. The first is for you to learn a bit about developing. The second is for you to find out if you like it. If you like developing it won't matter how much you suck at first. Soon you'll start to forget that you suck, and you'll keep at it, and you'll realize that's what developing is about: Developing things and sucking at it. And then sucking less. For those in the second group, feedback, bug reports, and feature requests reported through Github's issue tracking system are quite welcome.

### Who is this for?

Maybe you're a project manager who wants to understand when the neckbeards she works with are shining her on. Or a farmer, looking for omething to pass the time in winter. A Marine standing watch at an embassy or a sailor on a nuclear submarine. A bartender with too much college debt. One of those emo kids who hates football and wears axe body spray and vapes and fantasizes about cheerleaders. One of those beauty-queen trophy-wives who has always been quiet and perfect and who nobody thought was smart, but yesterday some fat ugly jerk threw shade on her Masters in Art History, and now she's going to show him what is the mothafuckin what. Your motivation doesn't matter to me because it doesn't matter to your code. Your code doesn't have feelings. It either a) works or b) doesn't. It doesn't care how old you are, where you live, what car you drive, or what your SAT score was. You won't need a credit card for these koans, and you won't need to be smart. Let me say that again:

You won't need to be smart.

### What do you need?

What you need to get started are a computer running Windows, OSX, or some flavor of Linux, an Internet connection, a few hour-long blocks of uninterrupted time to get started, a good attitude, some unhealthy curiosity, some obsessiveness, some stubbornness, some anger, the abilities to focus and pay attention to detail, and the humility to ask salty developer friends or strangers for help when you're stuck. This tutorial and these koans are hard; computers and software and other developers will make you feel stupid. They make me feel stupid every day. I wish I knew how to help you find out if you like developing without making you feel stupid. I don't. But if you finish these koans, nobody will be happier for you than me.

Not even your Mom.

### koans

What's a koan? Here's one definition that seems legit:

> A paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment

I'm no Zen Buddhist monk and hope you'll never abandon reason. But I have always had trouble learning from lectures and big, fat, door-stopper textbooks. The times I've learned quickest are after jumping in. You may not know what the German word for toilet is, but if you're visiting Munich during Oktoberfest, you'll figure it. So I'm going to give you a problem, or a koan, to solve, or reflect on, or whatever you want to call what you do after reading it. You're going to figure out how to solve the koan, and once you've solved it, you're going to move to the next koan, and then solve that koan, and then move to the next koan, and solve that one, until you're done or have decided this tutorial is not for you. I'm not going to teach you anything, you're going to teach yourself.

### Your first koan

The site you're reading these koans on is an amazing one now owned by Microsoft that's all about managing different versions, or branches, of a code base, or just any group of files known in this tutorial as a repository. These koans are organized into different chapters, corresponding to different versions of the code in our repo. Click around to get a feel for the site. When you've figured out how to change the "branch" of this repo to "chapter-1," please go ahead and do so.
