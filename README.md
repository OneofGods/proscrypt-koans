# Chapter 2

Now that our mise en place is set up, what are we going to do? A warrior I greatly admire used to say that all decisions we make follow a cycle of observe, orient, decide, act -- and then repeat. It's not as simple as that but his name was [John Boyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop), and you can read more about his cycle [here](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/ooda-loop/). Let's get started with an observation.

## Observation

I had broken my glasses skiing in Lake Tahoe, and was out of contact lenses, and so went to [Deputy Optics](https://www.deputyoptics.com/) in Carson City, Nevada. I showed Wesley there my broken glasses. He asked if I had my prescription. I didn't -- Who keeps eyeglass prescriptions in their wallet though anyways, right? -- Then he said he could call and get it from my optometrist. We called, only to be told the prescription was out of date, and it was the optometrist's policy not to send copies of out-of-date prescriptions. I didn't have time to get an appointment with a nearby optometrist, so Wesley used a machine to analyze the broken glasses to guess ate the prescription, and told me he'd have them ready the next day. Then wired my broken frames together and sent me home, amazed at his customer service and genuine concern.

But it bugged me that the optometrist wouldn't even send a copy of the old prescription. I mean, it's my medical record, not his, and I payed for it, so why can't I just have a copy of it, right? It turns out that optometrists in California and pretty much everywhere else in the US have bribed their state legislatures to prevent opticians from making glasses based on out of date prescriptions, supposedly in the patient's interest, but really in their own. They want you pay. I guess I don't blame them. If I could use the government to force everyone who wants to learn programming to pay me for this tutorial, I probably I would.

## Orient

Humans have different mental models we use to make decisions. A fighter pilot in a dogfight has her pedals and yoke, her radio, her gauges and instruments, and her training to put herself between the sun and any threat. A basketball player has her body, her knowledge of her teammates and her opponents, and her 3-point skills. You might have a mental model in place that allows you to avoid the frustration I experienced; maybe you asked your optometrist to email you a copy of your prescription so you can search for it later. But a regular person doesn't have tools or mental model to fight against crony health care -- except maybe with your vote or if you're wealthy enough, with a politician bribe. But a developer does. Your mental models are the tools we installed, your understanding of what it is to be polite to others and how to show respect, your understanding of economics, accounting, and business processes, and as we go through these koans you'll understand other models like [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) and [test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

 If you aren't a programmer, maybe your mental model would include calling your local representatives in congress. Or just complaining. But as developers, we have a whole bunch of different mental models we can use.


But I feel like that would probably make you angry, just as what optometrists are doing every day makes me angry. I mean it's my record, right? Why can't I have access to my records? Patronizing little crony jerks. So now it's payback time. I'm going to show you how to build a web app that takes away their power and gives it back to people like you and me. Obviously they'll fight and cry and try to make what we're doing illegal or something, but let's fight that battle when we have millions of dollars in venture capital to buy lawyers and politicians and beat them at their own game.

## koan 2.1

Think about a problem you have seen out there. Something that frustrated you. There are problems all over the place. For example, we have something like 40 years of medical statistics proving that birth control pills are safe, or at least not much more dangerous than cough syrup. And yet in order to get them prescribed, America's fatherly order of elite gynecologists has successfully lobbied the federal government to force women to show them their vaginas before having sex to a mostly male political class in the Senate and the House of Representatives by making the argument that if they don't control your ability to have sex using birth control pills, you won't come into their offices and let them look at your vaginas and make sure you aren't growing oysters down there. Or something. I'm not saying that it's a bad idea to go to the gynecologist to have your vagina checked for oysters, I'm just saying that patronizing behavior from doctors and politicians is a real thing, and that women are smart enough to use cough syrup without the cashier putting a speculum down their throats. You know? So for this koan, think of a problem you've seen and write a story about why you came to think of the problem like I did above. You can skip this koan but I'd love it if you wrote down your problem and emailed me a copy.

## koan 2.2

Now let's be a bit more specific about the problem we're trying to solve:

1. Prescriptions are still on paper. This means they
