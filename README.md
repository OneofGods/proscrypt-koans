# ProScrypt Koans

## Introduction

What's a koan? Well here's one definition that seems legit:

> A paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment

I'm no Zen Buddhist monk -- and hope you'll never abandon reason -- but have always had trouble learning from lectures and big fat door-stopper textbooks. The times I've grown quickest are after jumping in. You may not know what the German word for toilet is but you'll figure it out quick if you're visiting Munich in Oktober. I have two goals for you in writing these koans. The first is that you learn a bit about developing. The second is that you find out if you like it. Because if you like developing, it won't matter how bad you suck at it right now, or how slow you learn, or how much better or smarter other people are. If you like developing, you won't care how much you suck. You'll forget that you suck, and you'll keep at it, and you'll develop, and you'll realize that's what it's about: Developing things. Building things. Like a carpenter who cares about matching the grain on wood trim, even if his client doesn't, you'll be able to point to your work at the end of the day and say, "I made that."

Maybe you have different goals.

Maybe you're a project manager who wants to understand when the neckbeards she works with are shining her on. Or maybe you're in prison, looking for something to pass the time: An enlisted Marine standing watch, or a sailor on a nuclear submarine. A bartender with too much college debt. One of those emo kids in high school who hates football and fantasizes about cheerleaders and wears axe body spray and vapes in the bathroom between classes. A Dad with three kids by two different baby Mommas, who doesn't want them to grow up on food stamps. Maybe you're homeless. Shit, maybe you're one of those beauty-queen trophy-wives who's always been quiet, and perfect, and who nobody ever thought was smart, but yesterday some fat ugly slut threw shade on your Jimmy Choo's, and now you're going to show her what is the mothafucking what. Your motivation doesn't matter, because your code doesn't give care. Your code either a) works or b) does not. Your code doesn't have feelings. Your code won't care how old you are, where you live, what car you drive, what your SAT score was, or if you're good at math or science.

You won't need a credit card for these koans, and you won't need to be smart. Let me say that again:

You won't need to be smart.

What you do need is a few hour long blocks of uninterrupted time to get started, a good attitude, some unhealthy curiosity, some obsessiveness, some stubborn, the humility to ask people for help when you're stuck, a little bit of anger, and the abilities to focus and to pay attention to detail when you need to get things done.

Because this tutorial and these koans are hard.

Computers and software and other developers will make you feel stupid. They make me feel stupid every day. I wish I knew how to help you find out if you like developing without making you feel stupid. Sadly, I don't. But I do know that if you finish these koans, nobody will be happier for you than me.

Not even your Mom.

### koans

I'm going to give you a problem, or koan, to solve. Or reflect on. Whatever. You're going to figure out how to solve it, and once you've solved it, you're going to move onto the next koan, and then solve it, and move on to the next koan, until you're done. I'm not going to teach you anything. You're going to teach yourself.

### Your first koan

The site you're reading these koans on is all about managing different versions, or branches, of a code base -- or any group of files -- known as a repository. These koans are organized into different chapters, corresponding to different versions of the code in our repo. Click around to get a feel for the site.

When you've figured out how to change the "branch" of this repo to "chapter-1," do so.
