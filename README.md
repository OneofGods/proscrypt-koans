# ProScrypt Tutorial

## Introduction
The goal of this tutorial is to make its reader understand she can solve real
problems for millions of people using her computer, her internet connection, free software, free services, and her native wit. To achieve this goal she will plan, specify, build, test and deploy a web application which solves a real problem that, for reasons the author does not wish to speculate on, industry has not yet chosen to solve.

Things she will need:

 1. A computer with a relatively recent version of Windows, OSX, or Ubuntu.
 2. Internet access.
 3. A good attitude.
 4. Stubbornness.
 5. Curiosity.
 6. A desire to serve others.

 Things she will not need:

 1. A credit card.
 2. A fancy new computer.
 3. A degree in Computer Science.
 4. To be smart.
 5. To be a dork.
 6. Good grades.
 7. Help from anyone other than the writer of this tutorial. If she does need help from someone other than the author, that is a failure on the author's part, not on hers.

 Follow me.
