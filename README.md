# ProScrypt Koans

## Introduction

The goal of ProScrypt Koans is to help you decide if you like building things using computers and software. You do not need to be good at math, or good at science, or even to be particularly smart. No matter how smart you are, there will always be someone smarter than you and even that person will be made to feel stupid by a computer from time to time. Speaking of computers, you do not need a fancy one, almost any computer with an Internet connection will do. You do not need good grades or even a credit card. You should not need help from anyone, though if you do it is the writer's fault, not yours. All you need is a good attitude, curiosity, stubbornness, attention to detail, and a desire to serve others.

## Step 1: Terminal

Open your terminal. If you do not know what a terminal is, go to [duckduckgo.com](http://duckduckgo.com/) and type "How do I open my OPERATING SYSTEM terminal," replacing the capitalized letters in this sentence's immediately preceding clause with the name of your current machine's OS. When you've opened your terminal, and see something like [the image on the right side of this pae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_), move on.

## Step 2: Git

In your terminal, type:

`$ git --version`

If typing the above doesn't return something like:

`
git version 2.17.0
`

then please follow [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Otherwise, move on.

Step 3: Set up shop.
