# ProScrypt Koans

## Introduction

Have you ever wondered what it's like to build something awesome using computers and software? Something that doesn't yet exist, solves a real problem, and could disrupt a trillion dollar industry?

My goal is to help you find out.

You might have other goals. Maybe you're a project manager or a ui/ux designer who wants to understand when the little neckbearded shits she works with are wasting her time. Perhaps you're in prison literally, or just figuratively, looking for something to pass the time: An enlisted Army Ranger on watch, trying to keep awake; one of those emo kids in high school who hates football players and cheerleaders and vapes in the bathroom between class; a Dad with three kids by two different baby mommas who doesn't want to spend the rest of his life on food stamps. Maybe you're homeless. Maybe you're a beauty-queen-trophy-wife who has always been quiet, and perfect, and who nobody thought was smart enough, but yesterday some ugly hater threw shade on your Jimmy Choo's and now you're going to show that fat ugly slut what is the mothafuckin what. Any goal, any motivator is good enough for me, and for the purposes of these koans. I don't care what it is, and the code you write for these machines will care not at all. We don't care how old you are, where you live, what you drive, if you're good at math or science, if you've gotten good grades as a student in the past, where you went to college, what you studied, or even if you went to college at all. Speaking of machines, almost any machine with an Internet connection will do. You won't need a credit card, and you don't need to be smart. Let me type that again:

You don't need to be smart.

What you do need is a few blocks of uninterrupted time to get started, a good attitude, a bit of unhealthy curiosity, some obsessiveness, some stubborn, the ability to pay attention to detail, the ability to focus, the humility to ask people for help when you're stuck, and a little bit of anger. A chip on your shoulder, that's really what you need. Because this tutorial and these koans are hard. There's nothing simple or easy about them. Computers and software and other developers will make you feel stupid. They make me feel stupid every day. I wish there was a way to help you learn this stuff without making you feel stupid, because feeling stupid too often or for too long can break people.

I've seen it.

But if you finish these koans, if you overcome your rage and replace it with confidence, there's nobody who'll be happier for you than me, not even your Mom. Because I don't love you or accept you no matter what. My happiness wil come from having been in your shoes, feeling stupid and frustrated, and knowing I had a small part in turning your anger into confidence. My happiness will be 100% real because I will know what you've done to earn it.

### koans

What's a koan? Here's a definition of a koan that seems legit:

> a paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment

I'm not a Zen Buddhist monk and don't want you to abandon reason, but I dislike lecturing, or going into too much detail trying to explain things you may already know, and so I'm going to give you a problem to solve, and let you figure out how to solve it in the same way a monk might gain enlightenment by reflecting on a koan before moving onto the next one.

### Your first koan

The site you're reading these koans on is all about managing different versions or branches of a codebase -- or any group of files. These koans are organized into different chapters, which also correspond to different versions of our codebase. Please take some time to click around on this site to get a feel for it. When you've figured out how to change the "branch" of this codebase to "chapter-1", and have otherwise indulged your curiosity, please do so.
