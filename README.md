# ProScrypt Koans

## Introduction

My name is Fred. My goal with these koans is not to teach you how to be a developer but to help you find out if you like developing. If you like developing you will eventually become good at it, no matter how badly you suck at it now, no matter how slow you learn, and no matter how much better other people are at it than you are first. You might have other goals than finding out if you like developing. Maybe you're a project manager who wants to understand when the neckbeards she works with are shining her on. Maybe you're in prison literally, or just figuratively, and looking for something to pass the time: An enlisted sailor on watch, trying to keep awake; a server with too much college debt and a useless degree; one of those emo kids in high school who hates football players and cheerleaders, and wears axe body spray, and vapes in the bathroom between class; a Dad with three kids by two different baby Mommas, who doesn't want to spend the rest of his life on food stamps. Maybe you're homeless. Shit, maybe you're a beauty-queen-trophy-wife who has always been quiet, and perfect, and who nobody ever thought was smart enough, but yesterday some ugly hater skank threw shade on your Jimmy Choo's, and now you're going to show that fat ugly slut what is the mothafuckin what. I don't care what your goal or motivator is, and the code you write for these machines will care not at all. It won't care how old you are, where you live, what car you drive, if you're good at math or science, where you went to college, what you studied, or even if you went to college at all. Speaking of machines, almost any machine running OSX, Windows or Linux with an Internet connection will do. You won't need a credit card, and you don't need to be smart. Let me type that again:

You don't need to be smart.

What you do need is a few hour-long blocks of uninterrupted time to get started, a good attitude, a bit of unhealthy curiosity, some obsessiveness, some stubborn, the ability to pay attention to detail, the ability to focus -- Adderall and coffee can help -- the humility to ask people for help when you're stuck, and a little bit of anger. Because this tutorial and these koans are hard, and computers and software and other developers will make you feel stupid. They make me feel inadequate every day. I wish I knew how to help you learn this stuff without making you feel stupid, but I don't. All I know is that if you finish these koans, nobody will be happier for you than me. Not even your Mom. I don't love you or accept you unconditionally. My happiness will come from having been in your shoes, from having felt stupid and frustrated, and from knowing I had a small part in turning your frustration into confidence. My happiness will be conditional, sure, but it will be real, -- like my drill sergeant in the Army, who saw a fat kid with a weak upper body and who hated himself struggling to get up and over a wall at the beginning of basic training, and worked with him on diet and running and pushups to get his weight under control, and then one day saw me get up and over the wall on my way to becoming a stone cold warrior.

### koans

What's a koan? Here's one definition of a koan that seems legit:

> a paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment

I'm no zen buddhist monk and don't want you to abandon reason, but I dislike lecturing and going into too much detail and parentheticals trying to explain things -- that's not how I learn -- and so I'm going to give you a problem to solve, and let you figure out how to solve it on your own. I'm not going to teach you anything, you're going to teach yourself.

If you're having trouble with a koan, look for the blue link to "reflect" on it further.

### Your first koan

The site you're reading these koans on is all about managing different versions or branches of a code base -- or any group of files -- known as a repository. The koans are organized into different chapters which, not coincidentally, correspond to different versions of the code in our repository. Click around to get a feel for the site, and when you've figured out how to change the "branch" of this repository to "chapter-1," and otherwise indulged your curiosity, go ahead and change it.
