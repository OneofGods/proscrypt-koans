# ProScrypt Koans

## Introduction

My name is Fred, and my goal with these koans is to help you figure out if you like developing. That's really it. I'm not trying to teach you how to be a developer, or how to program, or how to code, or how to make money. If you want to learn those things, you can learn them later. For now let's just find out if you like developing. Because if you like developing, no matter how bad you suck, how slow you learn, how much better other people are at it than you at first, you'll keep at it and eventually become productive, and find meaning.

Your goals might not be the same as mine though.

Maybe you're a project manager who wants to understand when the neckbeards she works with are shining her on. Or maybe you're in prison, looking for something to pass the time: An enlisted Marine standing watch on a nuclear submarine; a bartender with too much college debt; one of those emo kids in high school who hates football and cheerleaders, and wears axe body spray, and vapes in the bathroom between classes; a Dad with three kids by two different baby Mommas, who doesn't want them to grow up on food stamps. Maybe you're homeless. Shit, maybe you're one of those beauty-queen-trophy-wives who's always been quiet, and perfect, and nobody ever thought was smart enough, but yesterday someone threw shade on your Jimmy Choo's, and now you're going to show that ugly slut what is the mothafucking what. Your motivation doesn't matter. Because your code doesn't give a shit. Your code either works or it doesn't. That's all. And neither do I. I don't even know you.

We won't care how old you are, where you live, what car you drive, what your SAT score was, or if you're good at math or science. You won't need a credit card. You don't need to be smart. Let me type that again:

You don't need to be smart.

What you do need is a few hour-long blocks of uninterrupted time to get started, a good attitude, some unhealthy curiosity, some obsessiveness, some stubborn, the humility to ask people for help when you're stuck, a little bit of anger, and the ability to pay attention to detail and focus -- I've found Adderall useful in the past. Because this tutorial and these koans are really fucking hard, and computers and software and other developers will make you feel stupid. They make me feel stupid every day. I wish I knew how to help you learn this stuff without making you feel stupid; all I know is that if you finish these koans, nobody will be happier for you than me.

Not even your Mom.

### koans

What's a koan? Here's one definition of a koan that seems legit:

> a paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment

I'm no Zen Buddhist monk and don't want you to abandon reason, but I dislike lecturing -- that's not how I learn -- and so I'm going to give you a problem to solve, and let you figure out how to solve it, and then when you've solved it, you can move onto the next koan. I'm not going to teach you a Goddamned thing. You're going to teach yourself.

Having said that, if you're having trouble with a koan, look for the blue link to "reflect" on it further.

### Your first koan

The site you're reading these koans on is all about managing different versions or branches of a codebase -- or any group of files -- known as a repository. The koans are organized into different chapters which, not coincidentally, correspond to different versions of the code in our repo. Click around to get a feel for the site, and when you've figured out how to change the "branch" of this repository to "chapter-1," do it.
