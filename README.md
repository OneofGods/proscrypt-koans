# Chapter 2

I promised I'd show you how to build something awesome and which would solve a real problem, one that affects me as well as the 61% of Americans who wear glasses.

I had broken my glasses skiing, and was out of contact lenses, and had to get a new pair. So I went to the eyeglass store and told them I needed a new pair, and they were all like "great, let's see your prescription." I told him I didn't have it on me -- I mean, who keeps eyeglass prescriptions in their wallet though anyways, right? -- and he said he could call and get it from the optometrist. We called, only to be told the prescription was out of date, and that it was the optometrist's policy not to send copies of out-of-date prescriptions. Apparently it is also the law in California and every other state where crony healthcare optometrists have captured government in order to force cows like you and me to pay them. I guess I don't blame them. If I could use the government to force everyone who wants to learn programming to pay me for this tutorial, I probably I would. But I feel like that would probably make you angry, just as what the optometrists are doing every day makes me angry. I mean it's my record, right? Why can't I have access to my records? Patronizing little crony jerks. So now it's payback time. I'm going to show you how to build a web app that takes away their power and gives it back to people like you and me. Obviously they'll fight and cry and try to make what we're doing illegal or something, but let's fight that battle when we have millions of dollars in venture capital to buy lawyers and politicians and beat them at their own game.

Think about a problem you have seen out there. Something that frustrated you. There are problems all over the place. For example, we have something like 40 years of medical statistics proving that birth control pills are safe, or at least not much more dangerous than cough syrup. And yet in order to get them prescribed, America's fatherly order of elite gynecologists has successfully lobbied the federal government to force women to show them their vaginas before having sex to a mostly male political class in the Senate and the House of Representatives by making the argument that if they don't control your ability to have sex using birth control pills, you won't come into their offices and let them look at your vaginas and make sure you aren't growing oysters down there. Or something. I'm not saying that it's a bad idea to go to the gynecologist to have your vagina checked for oysters, I'm just saying that patronizing behavior from doctors and politicians is a real thing, and that women are smart enough to use cough syrup without the cashier putting a speculum down their throats. You know? So for this koan, think of a problem you've seen and write a story about why you came to think of the problem like I did above. You can skip this koan but I'd love it if you wrote down your problem and emailed me a copy.

Now let's be a bit more specific about the problem we're trying to solve:

1. Prescriptions are still on paper. This means they
